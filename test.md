**Not shareable**

**4. Closed consent** : This data cannot be shared under any
circumstances… See note.

e\) Researcher to provide a written note/justification that has been
signed off at Faculty / School level explaining why consent is closed.

f\) If the research has been funded, did the funding application make
the case to not share any data ie the Funder is fully aware no data will
be shared? If not, funder sign-off for non-sharing of the data needs to
be secured.
